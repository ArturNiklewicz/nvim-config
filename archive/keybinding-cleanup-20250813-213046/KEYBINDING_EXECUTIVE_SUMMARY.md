# üìä Neovim Keybinding Analysis - Executive Summary

## üéØ Quick Overview

Your Neovim configuration contains **252 total keybindings** with significant organization issues that need attention.

### üö® Critical Findings

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Total Keybindings** | 252 | ‚úÖ Healthy |
| **Which-Key Coverage** | 20/252 (7.9%) | ‚ùå Critical |
| **Duplicate Definitions** | 32 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning |
| **Conflicting Keybindings** | 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning |
| **Unbinded References** | 381 | ‚ùå Critical |
| **Orphaned Keybindings** | 232 | ‚ùå Critical |

## üìà Key Statistics

### Distribution by Source
- **AstroCore**: 209 keybindings (83% of total)
- **VSCode Editing**: 22 keybindings
- **Which-Key**: 15 direct registrations
- **Other Plugins**: 6 keybindings

### Mode Distribution
- **Normal Mode**: ~250 bindings
- **Visual Mode**: ~15 bindings
- **Insert Mode**: ~5 bindings
- **Terminal Mode**: ~2 bindings

## üî¥ Critical Issues

### 1. **Which-Key Coverage Crisis**
- Only **7.9%** of keybindings are registered in Which-Key
- 232 keybindings are "orphaned" (not discoverable via Which-Key)
- Users cannot discover 92% of available keybindings through the visual menu

### 2. **Duplicate Keybindings**
Top duplicates found:
- `<leader>` defined 4 times
- `<Cmd>MCstart<CR>` defined 4 times
- `<cr>` defined 3 times
- `<Leader>?` defined 2 times (your help key conflict!)

### 3. **Neo-tree Mystery**
- Neo-tree IS configured with `<Leader>e` binding
- But it's not showing in Which-Key (part of the 232 orphaned bindings)

## ‚úÖ Actionable Solutions

### Immediate Actions (5 minutes)

1. **Fix Neo-tree visibility**:
   ```lua
   -- In which-key.lua, ensure Neo-tree bindings are registered
   ["<leader>e"] = { "<cmd>Neotree toggle reveal right<cr>", "Toggle Explorer" },
   ["<leader>E"] = { "<cmd>Neotree focus reveal right<cr>", "Focus Explorer" },
   ```

2. **Fix `<Leader>?` conflict**:
   - Check both `keybind-help.lua` and `which-key.lua`
   - Remove one of the duplicate definitions

3. **Test in Neovim**:
   ```vim
   :Lazy sync          " Update all plugins
   :checkhealth        " Verify plugin health
   :WhichKey <leader>  " Test which-key popup
   ```

### Short-term Fixes (1 hour)

1. **Register all AstroCore mappings in Which-Key**
2. **Create a keybinding audit checklist**
3. **Document all custom keybindings**

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Centralize keybinding definitions**
2. **Implement automated testing for keybinding conflicts**
3. **Create a keybinding documentation generator**

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Analysis Tools

### Quick Analysis
```bash
# Run the quick analyzer for instant results
./keybinding-quick-analyzer.sh
```

### Comprehensive Analysis
```bash
# Run the master analyzer (requires Lua environment)
./keybinding-master-analyzer.sh
```

### Check Specific Issues
```vim
" In Neovim:
:CheckNeotree        " Check Neo-tree status
:Keybindings         " Show all keybindings
:Keys                " Short alias for above
:WhichKey <leader>   " Show which-key menu
```

### Terminal Check
```bash
# From terminal
./nvim-keys          " Show all keybindings in terminal
```
