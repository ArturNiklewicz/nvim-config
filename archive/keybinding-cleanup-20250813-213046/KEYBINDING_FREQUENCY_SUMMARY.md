# 🚀 Frequency-Based Keybinding System - Complete

## ✅ What We Implemented

Based on your requirements for **full-stack, mobile, and AI development**, I've created a **frequency-based, 2-click system** with everything important instantly accessible.

## 📊 New Keybinding Organization

### **TIER 1: Most Frequent** (Direct access, no Which-Key menu)
Everything you use multiple times per minute:

| Key | Function | Why It's Here |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| `<Leader>t` | 🖥️ Float terminal | Your #1 request - instant terminal access |
| `<Leader>T` | Terminal split | Alternative terminal layout |
| `<Leader>e` | 📁 Oil file explorer | Better file management (replaced Neo-tree) |
| `<Leader>f` | 🔍 Find files | Quick file navigation |
| `<Leader>s` | 🔎 Search project | Find text anywhere |
| `<Leader>b` | 📑 Buffers | Switch between files |
| `<Leader>g` | 🌿 Git changes | View all git modifications |
| `<Leader>w` | 💾 Save | Quick save |
| `<Leader>q` | ❌ Quit | Quick exit |
| `<Leader>r` | 🔄 Rename symbol | Smart rename |
| `<Leader>R` | Rename all | Replace all occurrences |
| `<Leader>x` | 🧪 Run test | Auto-detects test type |
| `<Leader>a` | 🤖 Claude AI | AI assistance |
| `<Leader>y` | 📋 Copy to clipboard | System clipboard |
| `<Leader>1-9` | Buffers 1-9 | Direct buffer access |
| `<Leader>j/k` | Git changes nav | Jump between git changes |
| `<Leader>o` | 🔤 File symbols | Fuzzy find symbols |
| `<Leader>O` | Project symbols | All project symbols |
| `<Leader><Space>` | ⚡ Code action | Quick fixes |
| `<Leader>n/N` | Error navigation | Jump to errors |

### **TIER 2: Frequent** (Submenus for variations)
Used multiple times per hour:

| Submenu | Key | Contents |
|---------|-----|----------|
| **Git** | `<Leader>g+` | status, commits, branches, diff, stage/unstage |
| **Find** | `<Leader>f+` | files, grep, symbols, diagnostics, marks |
| **LSP** | `<Leader>l+` | definition, references, rename, format |
| **Terminal** | `<Leader>t+` | float, horizontal, vertical, multiple terminals |

### **TIER 3: Occasional** (Tucked away)
| Submenu | Key | Contents |
|---------|-----|----------|
| **UI** | `<Leader>u+` | zen mode, toggles |
| **Debug** | `<Leader>d+` | messages, errors, plugin info |

### **Non-Leader Shortcuts** (Ultra-fast)
| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| `Ctrl+`` | Float terminal (no leader!) |
| `Ctrl+\` | Toggle terminal |
| `Ctrl+s` | Save |
| `Tab/Shift+Tab` | Buffer cycling |
| `-` | Oil parent directory |
| `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` | Window navigation |

## 🎨 Philosophy

Your new system follows these principles:

1. **Frequency over categories** - Most-used keys are fastest to reach
2. **2-click maximum** - Everything important is `<Leader>` + one key
3. **No clutter** - Removed rarely-used mappings from quick access
4. **Visual hints** - Emojis for quick recognition
5. **Muscle memory** - Common operations always in the same place

## 📈 Coverage Stats

- **Total possible keybindings**: 191 from AstroCore
- **Frequency system coverage**: ~80 most important bindings
- **Direct access (Tier 1)**: 30+ instant operations
- **One submenu (Tier 2)**: 40+ common operations
- **Hidden (Tier 3)**: Everything else

## 💡 Tips

1. **Learn Tier 1 first** - These are your bread and butter
2. **Oil.nvim is powerful** - Edit directories like text files
3. **Terminal is always ready** - `<Leader>t` or `Ctrl+``
4. **Git navigation** - `<Leader>j/k` works everywhere
5. **Fuzzy finding** - `<Leader>o` finds any symbol fast

**Bottom Line**: You now have a streamlined, frequency-based system where everything important is 2 clicks away. Terminal, file management, git, and testing are all optimized for your full-stack/AI development workflow!
