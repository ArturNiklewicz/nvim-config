# Fix Keybinding Errors

## Immediate Fix

1. **Restore the original astrocore.lua:**
   ```bash
   cp ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/astrocore.lua.backup ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/astrocore.lua
   ```

2. **Test the patch approach first:**
   The file `astrocore_keybindings_patch.lua` extends your existing configuration instead of replacing it. This is safer and allows gradual migration.

3. **Restart Neovim** to see if the errors are resolved.

## The Issue

The error occurred because:
1. The `name` field is not supported by Neovim's standard keymap API
2. AstroNvim uses a specific format for mappings that doesn't support group definitions in the same way

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use the Patch File (Recommended)
Keep your original astrocore.lua and use the patch file which adds new keybindings gradually.

### Option 2: Manual Migration
1. Keep your existing astrocore.lua
2. Gradually add new keybindings one by one
3. Test after each addition

### Option 3: Use Which-key Groups Separately
The `which-key-groups.lua` file properly configures group names for which-key without interfering with the keymap definitions.

## Testing New Keybindings

After fixing the errors, test these key sequences:
- `<Space>w` - Should save file
- `<Space>q` - Should close buffer
- `<Space>e` - Should toggle file explorer
- `<Space>bb` - Should show buffer menu
- `<Space>sf` - Should find files

## If Problems Persist

1. Check `:messages` for detailed error information
2. Run `:Lazy` to ensure all plugins are loaded
3. Check for conflicting keybindings with `:verbose map <key>`
4. Consider disabling the new mappings temporarily

## Next Steps

Once the basic setup works:
1. Gradually migrate more keybindings
2. Update muscle memory with frequently used commands
3. Customize further based on your workflow
