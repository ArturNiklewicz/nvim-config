# Keybinding Cleanup Research Summary

**Research Date**: 2025-01-21
**Method**: /research-deep-dive with Sequential Thinking, Web Search, and Context7

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Keybindings missing from which-key menu and some not functioning.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Missing which-key group name registrations (`name` keys)
2. Missing description fields (`desc`) on mappings
3. Lazy loading timing issues with plugin keybindings
4. Buffer-local mappings not visible in global which-key menu
5. No systematic validation process

**Solution**: 5-phase strategic cleanup with automated diagnostics.

## Core Concepts

### AstroNvim v5 Keybinding System

**Architecture**:
- `astrocore.lua` provides centralized mapping configuration
- Mappings use `vim.keymap.set()` API under the hood
- Structure: `{mode} → {lhs} → {rhs, desc, ...opts}`
- which-key integration is automatic IF properly configured

**Mapping Structure**:
```lua
["<Leader>key"] = {
  "<cmd>Command<cr>",  -- RHS (action)
  desc = "Description" -- Required for which-key display
}
```

**Group Names**:
```lua
["<Leader>g"] = { name = "Git" }  -- Creates which-key menu group
```

### which-key.nvim Integration

**How it Works**:
- Automatically detects mappings with `desc` fields
- Groups mappings by prefix when `name` key exists
- Shows popup on prefix key press (e.g., `<Leader>`)
- Requires explicit registration for group names

**Common Issues**:
- Missing `desc` = invisible in menu
- Missing group `name` = ungrouped display
- Buffer-local mappings = not auto-detected
- Lazy-loaded plugins = timing issues

**Diagnostic Command**:
```vim
:checkhealth which-key  " Primary diagnostic tool
```

### Lazy Loading Timing

**The Problem**:
If you define a keybinding in `astrocore.lua` that calls a plugin command, but the plugin loads lazily (on demand), the first keypress may fail.

**The Solution**:
Use `keys = {}` property in plugin config:

```lua
-- In plugin config file
return {
  "plugin/name",
  keys = {
    { "<Leader>key", "<cmd>PluginCommand<cr>", desc = "Description" },
  },
}
```

This ensures:
1. Keybinding is registered immediately
2. Plugin loads when key is pressed
3. Command executes successfully

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Basic Mapping with Description

```lua
-- In astrocore.lua
mappings = {
  n = {
    ["<Leader>w"] = { "<cmd>bd<cr>", desc = "Close buffer" },
  }
}
```

**Result**: Shows "Close buffer" in which-key menu.

### Pattern 2: Group Name Registration

```lua
-- In astrocore.lua (add at TOP of mappings)
mappings = {
  n = {
    -- Group names first
    ["<Leader>g"] = { name = "Git" },
    ["<Leader>f"] = { name = "Find/Files" },

    -- Then actual mappings
    ["<Leader>gs"] = { "<cmd>Telescope git_status<cr>", desc = "Git status" },
    ["<Leader>ff"] = { "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", desc = "Find files" },
  }
}
```

**Result**: which-key shows "Git" and "Find/Files" groups with organized commands.

### Pattern 3: Plugin-Specific Keybindings

```lua
-- In lua/plugins/zen-mode.lua
return {
  "folke/zen-mode.nvim",
  cmd = "ZenMode",  -- Lazy load on command
  keys = {  -- Lazy load on keypress
    { "<Leader>uz", function() require("zen-mode").toggle() end, desc = "Toggle zen mode" },
  },
  opts = {
    -- plugin configuration
  }
}
```

**Result**: Keybinding works on first press, plugin loads on demand.

### Pattern 4: Buffer-Local Mappings

```lua
-- In plugin config (e.g., gitsigns.lua)
on_attach = function(bufnr)
  local function map(mode, lhs, rhs, opts)
    opts = opts or {}
    opts.buffer = bufnr
    vim.keymap.set(mode, lhs, rhs, opts)
  end

  map('n', ']c', function() gitsigns.nav_hunk('next') end, {desc = "Next git hunk"})
end
```

**Result**: Keybinding only active in buffers with plugin attached (e.g., git-tracked files).

### Pattern 5: Function-Based Mappings

```lua
-- In astrocore.lua
mappings = {
  n = {
    ["<Leader>w"] = {
      function()
        require("utils.buffer-nav").close_smart()
      end,
      desc = "Close buffer"
    },
  }
}
```

**Result**: Calls Lua function instead of command string.

## Decision Framework

### When to Use Each Pattern

| Scenario | Solution | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Global keybinding | `astrocore.lua` mappings | Centralized, always available |
| Plugin-specific key | Plugin config `keys = {}` | Lazy loading support |
| Buffer-local key | Plugin `on_attach` function | Only relevant for specific buffers |
| Group organization | Add `name` key in `astrocore.lua` | which-key menu structure |
| Conditional mapping | Use `cond` field | Only register when condition met |

### Performance Considerations

**Lazy Loading Benefits**:
- Faster startup time
- Less memory usage
- Plugins load only when needed

**When NOT to Lazy Load**:
- Core functionality (e.g., LSP, treesitter)
- Frequently used plugins (e.g., telescope)
- UI plugins (e.g., statusline, bufferline)

**Timing Trade-offs**:
- `event = "VeryLazy"` - Load after UI is ready (good default)
- `cmd = { "Command" }` - Load on command execution
- `keys = { ... }` - Load on keypress
- `ft = { "filetype" }` - Load for specific file types

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Mapping doesn't appear in which-key

**Diagnosis**:
```vim
:map <Leader>key          " Check if mapping exists
:verbose map <Leader>key  " See where it was defined
```

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Add `desc = "Description"` to mapping
2. ✅ Verify mapping is in correct mode (`n`, `v`, etc.)
3. ✅ Check if buffer-local (won't show in global menu)
4. ✅ Run `:checkhealth which-key` for issues

### Issue: Mapping doesn't work (error)

**Diagnosis**:
```vim
:Lazy                     " Check if plugin is loaded
:map <Leader>key          " Verify mapping exists
```

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Move to plugin config `keys = {}` if plugin-specific
2. ✅ Check command spelling/capitalization
3. ✅ Verify plugin is installed and loaded
4. ✅ Check for Lua errors in `:messages`

### Issue: Keybinding conflict

**Diagnosis**:
```vim
:KeybindingDiagnostics    " Custom diagnostic tool
:checkhealth which-key    " Shows overlapping keymaps
```

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Choose which mapping to keep
2. ✅ Remove duplicate from other location
3. ✅ Use different key for one of them

### Issue: Group name doesn't show

**Diagnosis**:
Check if you added:
```lua
["<Leader>g"] = { name = "Git" }
```

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Add group name at TOP of mappings section
2. ✅ Ensure it's in correct mode
3. ✅ Reload config: `:source %`
